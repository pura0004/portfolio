            <p>Emily Hsueh is an Ottawa-based multimedia creator, currently enrolled at Algonquin College in the
                Interactive
                Media Design program. She has worked various jobs in the industry over the last few years, with a
                particular
                passion for photography and graphic design. Other industry skill she possesses include videography,
                web
                development, UX and UI design and professional writing.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>IMD is Emily's second program; she is a graduate of the journalism program from both Algonquin
                College
                and
                the University of Ottawa. After receiving both her degree and diploma, Emily worked in Shawville - a
                small
                town in the rural quebec region of the Pontiac - at The Equity newspaper as a reporter, videographer
                and
                social media manager. But after a year in the newsroom, she decided she wanted to pursue a more
                creative
                career and returned to Algonquin.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>When she is not working, you can find Emily doing what she does best: being creative. She has been an
                artist
                for as long as she can remember, mainly making illustrations digitally with Photoshop, as well as
                creating
                costumes and props for cosplay. She also loves to make music; she's been playing piano for 20 years
                and
                double bass for 8, and played with semi-professional orchestras in the past. By night, you can find
                her
                online in one of her favourite video games, chatting with friends and gaming the night away.</p>
